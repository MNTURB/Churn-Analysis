# Churn Prediction with Machine Learning and Deep Learning
## Overview
This repository contains code for predicting customer churn in a telecom dataset using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* tensorflow
* imbalanced-learn
* graphviz (for decision tree visualization)

## Dataset
The data used was found online, you can dowload the csv file int the repository or in the original location at:
https://github.com/jamesrawlins1000/Telecom-CDR-Dataset-/blob/master/Call%20Details-Data.csv

### The code will perform these following tasks

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, etc.)
* Outlier detection and handling
* Model training and evaluation (Random Forest, LSTM, Decision Tree)
* Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
* Feature importance analysis
* Decision tree visualization
* PCA analysis
* Confusion matrix visualization.
